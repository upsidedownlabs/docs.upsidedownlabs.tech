Hardware
########

Upside Down Labs' team has developed a range of open-source BioAmp hardware, designed to record biopotential signals from the human body. These biopotential signals include:

- :bdg-danger:`Electrocardiogram (ECG):` Measures the electrical activity of the heart.
- :bdg-info:`Electromyogram (EMG):` Records the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles.
- :bdg-primary:`Electrooculogram (EOG):` Measures the electrical potential of the eyes.
- :bdg-success:`Electroencephalogram (EEG):` Captures the electrical activity of the brain.

BioAmp Hardware serves as a catalyst for the development of innovative Human-Computer Interface (HCI) and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) projects, enabling people to explore the field of neuroscience.
