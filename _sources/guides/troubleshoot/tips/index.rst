Tips for best signal acquisition
#################################

- When recording biopotential signals (EEG, ECG, EOG, or EMG), ensure your laptop **is not connected to its charger** 
  and maintain a **minimum distance of 5 meters** from any AC-powered appliances (e.g., motors, refrigerators) to 
  minimize interference noise and get better signal acquisition. Our body is essentially a "bag of salt water", when electodes are connected to our body it acts like an antenna picking up surrounding electromagnetic signals also known as Radio/AC interference noise. This interference noise includes radio waves (usually filtered in hardware) and 50Hz/60Hz AC noise from appliances, which is typically removed through software 
  filtering.

     tip for better signal acquisition
- Before placing electrodes on your body, prepare your skin thoroughly using `Nuprep skin preparation gel <https://store.upsidedownlabs.tech/product/nuprep-gel/>`_ to remove dead skin cells, 
  oils, & other substances. This will enhance the connection of electrodes to the skin surface and also decrease the 
  skin-electrode impedance which results in better signal acquisition. For more information, you can check out the complete :ref:`skin-preparation`.

- The electrode placements are different for recording different biopotential signals. So make sure you are placing the 
  electrodes at the correct positions. For more information, you can check out :ref:`gel electrodes usage guide <using-gel-electrodes>`.

- Gel electrodes are meant to be used only once and then discarded afterwards.

- Ensure that gel electrodes are properly in contact with the skin. If the electrodes start to peel off during extended 
  use, itâ€™s time to replace them with new ones. Usually it happens when you are sweating.

- Sit stable while recording the biopotential signals as swinging or moving BioAmp Cable can induce cable movement noise.
