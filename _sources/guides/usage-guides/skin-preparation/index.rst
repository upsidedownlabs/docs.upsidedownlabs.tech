Why skin preparation is important?
***********************************

Proper skin preparation is crucial before recording any biopotential signal be it Electrocardiography (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), Electroencephalography (EEG), or Electrooculography (EOG).

- ``Clean skin surface:`` Removes dead skin cells, oils, & other substances that increases skin impedance.
- ``Improve impedance:`` Improves the conduction of electrical signals from the body to the recording equipment and minimizes impedance.
- ``Electrode-skin contact:`` Ensures optimal contact between the electrodes and the skin surface.
- ``Signal quality:`` Enhances the overall quality of recorded signals, providing clear & reliable data for analysis & improves the ability to capture subtle variations in biopotential signals.
- ``Consistency in recordings:`` Reduces variability in signal quality, making it easier to make any Human-Computer Interface (HCI), Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) project or a real-world application.
- ``Long term adhesion:`` Facilitates long-term adhesion & stable placement of electrodes to the skin during extended signal monitoring.

Steps to follow
*****************

You can follow the steps given below to do the skin preparation properly:

Step 1: Identify the targeted area
=====================================

Identify the target area where the gel electrodes or BioAmp Bands will be placed for recording the biopotential signals.

    Target area to record EOG

.. figure:: media/skin-prep-emg.*

    Target area to record EMG

.. figure:: media/skin-prep-ecg.*

    Target area to record ECG

.. figure:: media/skin-prep-eeg.*
    :align: center

    Target area to record EEG

Step 2: Apply NuPrep gel
==========================

Take a small amount of NuPrep gel using a cotton swab and apply it on your targeted area.

.. figure:: media/step-2.*

Step 3: Clean the skin surface
===============================

Use gentle, circular motions to rub the gel on the skin surface. This removes all the dead skin cells & improves conductivity.

.. figure:: media/step-3.*
    :align: center

    Rub the gel gently using the cotton swab

.. warning:: Do not rub the gel for too long as it has abrasive properties and may cause skin redness and irritation.

Step 4: Wipe off the gel
===================================

Wipe away excess gel with alcohol swabs or wet wipes.

    Wipe away access gel

.. warning:: - Using alcohol swabs can dry out the skin, so don't use them if your skin is already dry.
    
    - Close your eyes while using the alcohol swabs for EOG recording else it may cause eye redness & irritation.

Step 5: Measuring the signals
=================================

Now you can either use gel electrodes or BioAmp bands for the signal recording.

Using gel electrodes
----------------------

Connect the BioAmp cable to gel electrodes, peel the plastic backing from electrodes and place the IN+, IN-, REF cables according to your specific biopotential recording.

    Placing gel electrodes on skin surface

.. note:: While placing the gel electrodes on the skin, make sure to place the non-sticky tab of the electrode in the direction opposite to your hair growth. This allows you to remove the electrodes easily without pulling off much body hair.

Using BioAmp bands
----------------------

Connect the BioAmp cable to your BioAmp band. Now apply a small amount of ``electrode gel`` or ``Ten20 conductive paste`` on the dry electrodes between the skin and metallic part of BioAmp cable. This improves the signal conductivity, enhancing overall signal quality.

    Method 2: Using Ten20 paste

.. note:: The above graphics demonstrates the use of electrode gel/Ten20 paste with Muscle BioAmp Band. Similarly you can use Brain BioAmp Band and Heart BioAmp Band. Refer to :ref:`using-bioamp-bands` guide to assemble and use all the BioAmp Bands correctly.

Now you are all set! Make all the connections correctly and start recording your biopotential signals.

.. warning:: NuPrep gel, Ten20 paste and the alcohol swabs shouldn't be used if you have a history of skin allergies to lotions and cosmetics.
