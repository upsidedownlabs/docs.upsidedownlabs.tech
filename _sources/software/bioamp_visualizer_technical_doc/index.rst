Why Chromium Based Browsers
***************************

The web application relies on the Web Serial API to function correctly. This API enables web applications to communicate with serial devices directly from the browser.

Currently, the Web Serial API is supported by the following browsers:

* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Opera

If your browser does not support this API, the application will display a message informing you of the incompatibility and suggesting the use of a supported browser.

The web application ensures that your browser supports the Web Serial API. If your browser is not compatible, a message like below will be displayed informing you of the issue.

    Non Compatibility Message


For more detailed information on browser compatibility and implementation details, refer to the `MDN Web Docs on the Web Serial API <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API>`_.


Technical Capabilities
**************************

1. Signal Visualization
=======================

- **Purpose:** We are displaying real time data from the Arduino board to the :ref:`bioamp-visualizer-smoothiecharts`.
- **Multi-Channel Plotting:** We are plotting data from multiple sensors or channels simultaneously. Each channel is represented by a different color on different charts, allowing users to monitor various data streams in different graphs.
- **Time-Series Data Representation:** The data is displayed as a time series, meaning that it shows how the values change over time. This is crucial for observing patterns and analyzing the behavior of the signals.

2. Speed Adjustment
====================

- **Functionality:** Users can control the speed at which the graph updates by clicking the speed button. This button toggles between two speeds: slow(20 millis/pixel) and fast(10 millis/pixel).
- **Visual Aids:** Arrows are provided to assist users in selecting the desired speed. These arrows make it easier to understand and switch between the available speed settings, enhancing the user experience.

3. Scale Adjustment
===================

- **Auto-Scale Feature:** The graph automatically adjusts its y-axis scale based on the capabilities of the connected Arduino. When auto-scale is activated via the navbar, the system queries the Arduino to determine the maximum value of its analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
- **Example:** For an Arduino R3 with a 10-bit ADC, the maximum value is 1023. The graphâ€™s y-axis is then scaled from 0 to 1023. This dynamic adjustment ensures that the entire range of data values is visible, optimizing the display for the specific hardware used.

4. Data Management
==================

- **Signal Recording:** Users can record the data collected from the Arduino. This functionality allows for the preservation of real-time data for later analysis.
- **CSV File Export:** Data from all channels will be exported to a CSV file. This feature is useful for detailed analysis and for research purposes. The CSV export includes comprehensive data from all channels, facilitating easy examination of the recorded data.

Technologies Used
*****************

HTML 
=====

**Purpose**: HTML provides the foundational structure for web pages. It uses elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms to define the content and layout of a webpage.

**Role in our Project**: HTML is used to create the layout of our web application, including the navigation bar, modals, buttons, and containers (canvas) for charts. It defines the semantic structure and organizes the content, ensuring that all elements are properly placed and accessible.

CSS 
========

**Purpose**: CSS is used to style the visual presentation of HTML elements. It controls aspects such as layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.

**Role in our Project**: CSS is responsible for the look and feel of our web application. It ensures that the design is visually appealing and responsive, adapting the layout to different screen sizes and devices.

JavaScript
============

**Purpose**: JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows for actions like event handling and real-time updates.

**Role in our Project**: JavaScript implements the core functionality of our application. It handles events like button clicks (e.g., refreshing the page, connecting, starting, recording), manages the state of the application (e.g., enabling or disabling buttons), and interacts with other components like modals.

Web Serial API 
==============

**Purpose**: The Web Serial API allows web applications to access and communicate with Arduino Board directly from the web browser. This enables real-time data exchange and control of hardware like microcontrollers, sensors, and other devices that use serial communication.

**Role in our Project**: The Web Serial API is crucial for our application as it facilitates direct interaction with connected Arduino Board. It enables functionalities such as:

- **Connecting to Arduino Board**: Establishes a connection with Arduino Board for data exchange.
- **Reading Data**: Continuously reads data from the connected device, allowing real-time monitoring and processing.
- **Writing Data**: Write data to arduino, we specifically using this for autoscale feature, when user clicks the autoscale button, web serial api writes 'b' charector to arduino board on which board returns the maximum value of signal it can show.
