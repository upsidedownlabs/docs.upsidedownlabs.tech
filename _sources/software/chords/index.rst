Overview
********
Chords is an open source web application designed for real-time signal visualization, particularly tailored for bio-potential signals like EEG, EMG, ECG and EOG. This tool serves as an advanced alternative to the standard Arduino IDE serial plotter, offering enhanced functionality for students, researchers and hobbyists alike who want to record biopotential data using  `BioAmp hardware <https://docs.upsidedownlabs.tech/hardware/index.html>`_.

Features
********
- **Connection**: It is effortlessly compatible with BioAmp Hardware attached to an Arduino-compatible development board running the `Chords Arduino firmware <https://github.com/upsidedownlabs/Chords-Arduino-Firmware>`_, simplifying the setup process and ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow from data acquisition to visualization.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Experience smooth real-time visualization of incoming data rendered with `WebGL-Plot <https://github.com/danchitnis/webgl-plot>`_. The system ensures smooth signal display, helping you monitor the flow without interruptions or lag.
- **Recording**: You can record data in CSV format indefinitely or set a timer to stop recording automatically when it expires.
- **Download/Delete**: Easily download or delete recorded data with just a few clicks. Manage your data efficiently, allowing for quick access to relevant data or removal of unwanted data to free up storage.
- **Zoom**: Zoom-in and zoom-out feature, gives you more control as now you can either zoom in to look at signal or zoom out for an overall view.
- **Theme Toggle**: Offers both light and dark themes, enabling you to switch according to your preference for a more comfortable user experience.
- **Pause/Play**: Includes options to freeze and resume data display, allowing users to pause the visualization for detailed examination and then continue data monitoring seamlessly.
- **Channel**: Supports plotting of up to six channels of data simultaneously in real time where each stream is color-coded differently for easy identification.
- **Disconnect**: Terminate the connection to the development board with a simple click. This functionality ensures a hassle-free disconnection process when youâ€™re done with data collection or visualization.

Software Requirements
*********************

* You have to flash  `Chords Arduino Firmware <https://github.com/upsidedownlabs/Chords-Arduino-Firmware>`_ to your Arduino board using Arduino IDE.
* For now the Chords web application is only compatible with Chromium-based browsers. To check your browser compatibility, see :ref:`chords-browsers-compatibility` section of this page.

Hardware Requirements
*********************
To use Chords, you need:

- Compatible Development Board : Arduino Uno R3 And R4 Minima

How to Use Chords
*******************

Uploading the Code
------------------

1. Connect the Arduino board to your laptop using the USB cable.
2. Copy and paste the `Arduino Firmware  <https://github.com/upsidedownlabs/Chords-Arduino-Firmware>`_ into the Arduino IDE.
3. Select your board from `Board` section in the tools menu.
4. Choose the correct COM port in the tools menu (the one that disappears when you disconnect the board).
5. Click on the `Upload` button to flash your Arduino board.

Now, you are ready to use `Chords <https://chords.upsidedownlabs.tech/stream>`_.

Using the Software
------------------

1. Click the ``Connect`` button to establish a connection with the Arduino and start streaming.
2. Use the ``Play/Pause`` button to control the data stream.
3. Click the ``Record`` button to start recording data into a CSV file.
4. To save the recorded data, click the ``Download`` button.
5. Click the ``Delete`` button to remove recorded data.
6. Change the mode using the ``Mode`` button which is present in the navbar.
7. Use the ``Zoom in/out`` button to adjust the data visualization.
8. Adjust the number of channels by using the ``Plus/Minus`` buttons.
