Features
--------

- Streams multi-channel bio-potential signals over LSL.   
- Works with any Chords-compatible firmware build.  
  
What is Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)?
------------------------------------

Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) is an open-source protocol and software framework for real-time streaming of time-synchronized data, especially in neuroscience and biomedical experiments.

LSL is an open-source networked middleware ecosystem to stream, receive, synchronize, and record neural, physiological, and behavioral data streams acquired from diverse sensor hardware.

To know more about LSL `click here <https://labstreaminglayer.org/#/>`_.
