FFT Analysis and EEG Band Spectrum Plotting
===========================================

Overview
--------

We have introduced **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis** and **EEG band spectrum plotting** to improve real-time signal processing. These features enable you to visualize and analyze EEG frequency bands, providing deeper insights into brain activity.  

Features
--------

.. list-table:: Features
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Feature**
     - **Description**
   * - **Download EEG Data**
     - Save recorded channel data as a **CSV file** for further analysis, storage, or external visualization.
   * - **Live EEG Band Monitoring**
     - View real-time plots of EEG band values for better brain activity tracking.


Supported EEG Bands
-------------------

- **Delta (0.5 - 4 Hz)** → Associated with deep sleep and unconscious states.  
- **Theta (4 - 8 Hz)** → Linked to relaxation, meditation, and light sleep.  
- **Alpha (8 - 13 Hz)** → Reflects calm, wakeful relaxation, often seen during closed-eye rest.  
- **Beta (13 - 30 Hz)** → Related to active thinking, problem-solving, and focus.  
- **Gamma (30 - 100 Hz)** → Involved in high-level cognitive functioning, attention, and perception.  

Running the Application 
------------------------

1. Select **"FFT Visualizer"** to see your brainwaves in real time. 
2. The **top segment** displays filtered EEG data using a **45Hz low-pass filter** to remove noise.  
3. The **bottom segment** is divided into two sections: 

   - **Left side** → Shows EEG frequency values in Hz.  
   - **Right side** → Offers two interactive modes:  

     - **Band Power Mode** → Displays real-time EEG band power values.  
     - **Beta Candle Mode** → A unique visualization where a glowing candle represents your focus level.  

       - **Brighter candle** = Higher beta waves = Strong focus.  
       - **Dim candle** = Lower beta waves = Distraction.
