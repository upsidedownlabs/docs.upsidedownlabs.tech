Heart (ECG) BioAmp Arduino Firmware
#####################################

What is Electrocardiography (ECG)?
**************************************

Electrocardiography `[1] <https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983>`_ is the process of 
producing an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), a recording of the heart's 
electrical activity through repeated cardiac cycles.
It is an electrogram of the heart which is a graph of voltage versus time of the electrical activity 
of the heart using electrodes placed on the skin. These electrodes detect the small electrical 
changes that are a consequence of cardiac muscle depolarization followed by repolarization during 
each cardiac cycle (heartbeat).

To know more about ECG `visit here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography>`_.

Let's explore all the experiments step by step
***********************************************

.. Experiment 1

.. dropdown:: 1. Fixed Sampling
    :open:
    
    **1. Program Purpose & Overview**

    The **Fixed Sampling** program reads the raw electrical signal of your heart (ECG) 
    using an analog pin and prints it to the Serial Monitor. It's useful for understanding 
    what the unfiltered heart signal looks like. Think of it like looking at the "raw ingredients" before cooking.

    **2. How It Works**

    - ``analogRead(A0)`` reads voltage from the Heart BioAmp sensor.
    - ``Serial.println()`` prints those values to the computer.
    - A timer ensures values are read at a steady rate.

    You can see how heart beats changes the waveform.
    
    **3. Perform the Hardware**
    
    - Refer to wiring as per instructions given in :ref:`Connect Your Hardware<heart-bioamp-arduino-firmware-connect-hardware>`

    **4. Firmware Upload**

    - For this project, navigate to the repository folder (Heart-BioAmp-Arduino-Firmware/1_FixedSampling) and select ``1_FixedSampling.ino``.
    - To upload firmware, refer to :ref:`How to upload the Code to Arduino<heart-bioamp-arduino-firmware-code-upload>`
    
    **5. Visualize your signal**

    - Follow the steps given in :ref:`Visualize Your Heart Signals! <heart-bioamp-arduino-firmware-visualize-signals>` 
  
    **6. Running & Observing Results**

    - The numbers jump up and down rapidly, reflecting every tiny fluctuation in the raw ECG voltage.
    - Baseline wander (slow drift up/down over seconds).
    - High‚Äëfrequency spikes (muscle noise, line interference).
    - The peaks corresponding to heartbeats are buried in noise and drift‚Äîthis is purely your unfiltered signal.

.. dropdown:: 2. ECG Filter

    **1. Program Purpose & Overview**

    The **ECG Filter** program passes your raw ECG through a digital band‚Äëpass filter (0.5‚Äì44.5‚ÄØHz), 
    removing baseline drift and high‚Äëfrequency noise so you see only the heart‚Äôs true waveform.

    Real ECGs have very slow wandering trends (e.g. breathing‚Äërelated drift) and high‚Äëfrequency 
    interference (muscle noise, powerline hum). A band‚Äëpass filter isolates the clinically relevant 
    0.5‚Äì44‚ÄØHz band where the QRS complex and T‚Äëwaves live.

    **2. How It Works**

    - Uses a bandpass IIR filter order and coefficients chosen to sharply cut below 0.5‚ÄØHz and above 44.5‚ÄØHz.
    - Applies filter sample‚Äëby‚Äësample inside the same fixed‚Äërate loop.
    - Prints filtered values to Serial Monitor.
    - To learn more about filters and how to generate new filters, visit:  https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.butter.html

    **3. Perform the Hardware**

    - Refer to wiring as per instructions given in :ref:`Connect Your Hardware<heart-bioamp-arduino-firmware-connect-hardware>`

    **4. Firmware Upload**

    - For this project, go to the repository folder (Heart-BioAmp-Arduino-Firmware/2_ECGFilter) and select ``2_ECGFilter.ino``.
    - To upload firmware, refer to :ref:`How to upload the Code to Arduino<heart-bioamp-arduino-firmware-code-upload>`
    
    **5. Visualize your signal**

    - Follow the steps given in :ref:`Visualize Your Heart Signals! <heart-bioamp-arduino-firmware-visualize-signals>` 

    **6. Running & Observing Results**

    - A smooth, centered waveform where the QRS complexes (the heart‚Äôs main spikes) and T‚Äëwaves stand out clearly.
    - You should easily spot the repeating pattern of one large spike (R‚Äëpeak) followed by smaller waves (P and T waves).
    - If you flex or cough gently, you may see transient artifacts‚Äîthese will be suppressed compared to the unfiltered signal.

.. dropdown:: 3. Heart Rate Detection

    The **Heart Rate Detection** transforms your filtered ECG signal into a live, numerical heart‚Äërate readout. 
    As the Arduino continuously samples the cleaned‚Äëup ECG waveform from the BioAmp EXG Pill, this sketch 
    identifies each heartbeat‚Äôs characteristic R‚Äëwave peak and timestamps its occurrence. By measuring the 
    time between successive peaks, it calculates your beats per minute (BPM) and prints the result to the 
    Serial Monitor, giving you a real‚Äëtime view of your current heart rate without any external software or display.

    Under the hood, the sketch operates like a simple digital stethoscope: it maintains a running scan of the 
    incoming ECG, and whenever the signal sharply rises above a chosen threshold‚Äîindicating an R‚Äëwave‚Äîit
    marks that as one beat. It then computes the interval since the previous beat and applies the standard 
    conversion (60‚ÄØ000‚ÄØms divided by the interval) to determine BPM. This approach delivers an immediate and 
    intuitive heart‚Äërate measurement, turning raw biopotential spikes into meaningful, human‚Äëreadable data.

    For detailed guide, visit our **Instructables Page**: `Measuring Heart Rate Using BioAmp EXG Pill <https://www.instructables.com/Measuring-Heart-Rate-Using-BioAmp-EXG-Pill/>`_

.. dropdown:: 4. Heart Beat Detection

    The **Heart Beat Detection** program converts your filtered ECG waveform into a reliable count of heartbeats 
    by monitoring the signal‚Äôs ‚Äúenergy‚Äù rather than raw peaks. As the Arduino continuously reads the cleaned ECG 
    from the BioAmp EXG Pill, this sketch computes a short‚Äëterm measure of signal variability‚Äîessentially a running
    envelope or standard deviation of the voltage. Whenever that envelope surges above a tuned threshold 
    (indicating the rapid voltage change of an R‚Äëwave), the code registers a single heartbeat and then waits
    for the signal to subside below the threshold again, ensuring each beat is counted only once.

    By tracking the moments when the envelope crosses its threshold, the sketch builds a real‚Äëtime tally of your 
    heartbeats. Rather than simply looking for voltage spikes, it uses the envelope to smooth out noise and 
    baseline drift, making it far more robust in everyday, less‚Äëcontrolled settings. The result is a dependable 
    heartbeat counter that works even if the ECG amplitude varies or your electrodes shift slightly‚Äîperfect for 
    basic heart‚Äërate monitoring without complex peak‚Äëdetection circuitry.

.. dropdown:: 5. BLE Heart Rate Detection

    To be documented.

.. dropdown:: 6. Faster Heart Rate Detection

    **1. Program Purpose & Overview**

    The **Faster Heart Rate Detection** sketch delivers the same beat‚Äëto‚ÄëBPM functionality as its predecessor
    but in a highly optimized package. It reads your ECG from the BioAmp EXG Pill and Muscle BioAmp Shield at a
    controlled 125‚ÄØHz rate, applies a four‚Äëstage Butterworth band‚Äëpass IIR filter to isolate the 0.5‚Äì44.5‚ÄØHz 
    heartband, then detects each R‚Äëwave using a running‚Äëbuffer envelope method. Rather than simple 
    threshold‚Äëcrossing, it uses a small circular window of recent samples to compute both the mean and standard 
    deviation, flagging a heartbeat only when the incoming sample exceeds the current mean by more than half the 
    window‚Äôs standard deviation and respects a brief debounce interval.

    **2. How It Works**
    
    - Fixed‚Äêrate sampling at 125‚ÄØHz using a microsecond timer (micros() + timer loop) ensures consistent data intervals with very little timing overhead.
    - Inlined 4‚Äësection Butterworth IIR filter (ECGFilter()) removes baseline drift and high‚Äëfrequency noise in a single pass, avoiding function‚Äëcall costs.
    - Envelope‚Äëbased peak detection over a 26‚Äësample circular buffer computes mean and standard deviation on the fly, flagging a heartbeat only when the current sample exceeds mean + 0.5 √ó stddev.
    - Debounce logic (peakCooldownPeriod = 2‚ÄØms) uses just two Booleans and a timestamp to prevent false re‚Äëtriggers on the same beat.
    - Circular timing buffers (timeBuffer/sumBuffer, size‚ÄØ5) average recent inter‚Äëbeat intervals before converting to BPM, smoothing out irregularities without large loops.

    **3. Perform the Hardware**

    - Refer to wiring as per instructions given in :ref:`Connect Your Hardware<heart-bioamp-arduino-firmware-connect-hardware>`

    **4. Firmware Upload**

    - For this project, go to the repository folder (Heart-BioAmp-Arduino-Firmware/6_Faster_HeartRateDetection) and select ``6_Faster_HeartRateDetection.ino``.
    - To upload firmware, refer to :ref:`How to upload the Code to Arduino<heart-bioamp-arduino-firmware-code-upload>`
    
    **5. Visualize your signal**

    - Follow the steps given in :ref:`Visualize Your Heart Signals! <heart-bioamp-arduino-firmware-visualize-signals>` 
  
    **6. Running & Observing Results**
    
    - Smooth Readings: Thanks to the small moving‚Äêaverage buffer, your displayed BPM stays steady, even if a beat comes slightly early or late.
    - Low CPU Usage: The loop remains fast and responsive, so you can add displays or wireless features without missing any heartbeats.

.. dropdown:: 7. OLED BPM

    The OLED BPM program turns your Arduino‚Äëmeasured heart rate into a real‚Äëtime, on‚Äëscreen display. As your BioAmp sensor and beat‚Äëdetection code calculate BPM, this sketch:
    
    - Renders large, easy‚Äëto‚Äëread numerals on a 128√ó64 OLED so you can see your current heart rate at a glance.
    - Updates the display instantly each time a new heartbeat is detected, keeping the shown BPM in sync with your pulse.
    - Optionally animates a pulsing icon or simple bar alongside the number, giving a visual ‚Äúheartbeat‚Äù cue.

    In other words, OLED BPM makes your Arduino setup function as a standalone heart‚Äërate monitor‚Äîno PC, phone, or external plotting required.
