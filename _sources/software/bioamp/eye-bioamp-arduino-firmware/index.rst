Eye (EOG) BioAmp Arduino Firmware
#####################################

What is Electrooculography (EOG)?
==================================

Electrooculography (EOG) `[1] <https://eyewiki.org/Electrooculogram>`_  is a technique for measuring the corneo-retinal standing potential that exists between the front and the back of the human eye. The resulting signal is called the electrooculogram. 
Primary applications are in ophthalmological diagnosis and in recording eye movements. To measure eye movement, pairs of electrodes are typically placed either above and below the eye or to the left and right of the eye. 
If the eye moves from center position toward one of the two electrodes, 
this electrode "sees" the positive side of the retina and the opposite electrode "sees"
the negative side of the retina. Consequently, a potential difference occurs between the electrodes. 
Assuming that the resting potential is constant, the recorded potential is a measure of the eye's position.


To know more about EOG `visit here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrooculography>`_.

3. Pick the folder for the experiment you want to try. (For beginners: start with the first one and move step-by-step through the others for a better learning experience )
4. Inside that folder, open the **.ino** file using **Arduino IDE**
   
- For example:

  - To try raw signal: open ``01_FixedSampling.ino``
  - To try filtered signal: open ``02_EOGFilter.ino``

.. note::
    You'll find all the experiments listed below, each with :ref:`step-by-step instructions<experiments step by step>`. Just scroll to the one you're working on to get started with the right setup.
   
5. Connect Your Arduino

   - Plug your Arduino board into your computer‚Äôs USB port using the USB cable.
   - Wait for the operating system to install any required USB drivers.

6. In Arduino IDE:

   - Go to **Tools > Board > Arduino UNO** choose the model of your board (e.g., ‚ÄúArduino Uno‚Äù or ‚ÄúArduino Nano‚Äù if you wired to a Nano)
   - Go to **Tools > Port > [select the correct COM port]**

7.	Verify (Compile) the Sketch

        - Click the **‚Äú‚úîÔ∏è Verify‚Äù** button (or press ``Ctrl + R``).
        - Wait for **‚ÄúDone compiling.‚Äù** If errors appear, double-check you opened the correct .ino file.

8.  Click the **‚úì** Upload (or press ``Ctrl + U``) button to send the code to your Arduino.  

    - The IDE will compile again and then send the code to your board.
    - The onboard LED labeled **‚ÄúL‚Äù** may blink during upload. When you see **‚ÄúDone uploading‚Äù**, the new firmware is running.


9. Open Serial Monitor and Serial Plotter (Optional)

   - For serial monitor and plotter, we recommend using `Chords Web <https://chords.upsidedownlabs.tech>`_. However, if you're learning to develop, you might also find these options useful.

   - For Serial Monitor: In the IDE, click **Tools ‚Üí Serial Monitor** (or press ``Ctrl + Shift + M``).
   - Ensure the baud rate at the bottom right of the Serial Monitor is set to ``115200`` (or whatever the sketch‚Äôs Serial.begin(115200); line specifies).
   - You should start seeing lines of numbers. Those are your readings.


   - For Serial Plotter: In the IDE, click **Tools ‚Üí Serial Plotter**.
   - You should start seeing plotting of graph and visualize the waves.

.. _experiments step by step:

Let's explore all the experiments step by step
===============================================
.. Experiment 1

.. dropdown:: 1. Fixed Sampling
    :open:
    
    **1. Program Purpose & Overview**

    The **Fixed Sampling** program reads the raw electrical signal from the eyes (Electrooculography or EOG) 
    using an analog pin and prints it to the Serial Monitor. It's useful for understanding 
    what the unfiltered eye signal looks like. Think of it like looking at the "raw ingredients" before cooking.

    **2. How It Works**

    - ``analogRead(A0)`` reads voltage from the Eye BioAmp sensor.
    - ``Serial.println()`` prints those values to the computer.
    - A timer ensures values are read at a steady rate (e.g., 500 times per second or 500 Hz).

    You can see how blinking or moving eyes changes the waveform.
    
    **3. Perform the Hardware**
    
    - Refer to wiring as per instructions given in :ref:`Connect Your Hardware<Connect Your Hardware>`

    .. Experiment 2

.. dropdown:: 2. EOG Filter
 
    **1. Program Purpose & Overview**

    The **EOG Filter** program cleans the raw signal by removing slow drift (DC offset) and high-frequency noise.
    It gives a more accurate view of intentional eye movements.

    **2. How It Works**

    - Uses a bandpass IIR filter (0.5 Hz to 19.5 Hz).
    - Stores several recent samples in an array (circular buffer).
    - For each new reading, calculates a weighted average using filter coefficients.
    - Prints filtered values to Serial Monitor.

    **6. Running & Observing Results**

    - A smoother, more stable signal.
    - Eye blinks and movement are easier to detect visually.
.. Experiment 3

.. dropdown:: 3. Drowsiness Detection

    The **Drowsiness Detection** sketch helps detect drowsiness or sleepiness by measuring blink intervals. 
    If someone doesn‚Äôt blink for a long time or their eye remains closed, the system can 
    raise an alert (e.g., buzz).
    
    - It continuously reads EOG signal.
    - Calculates the signal envelope (peak activity).
    - If envelope is above a blink threshold, it counts as a blink.
    - Measures time between blinks.
    - If time exceeds a set limit ‚Üí triggers buzzer.

.. Experiment 4

.. dropdown:: 4. EOG Photo Capture BLE

    To be documented.

.. dropdown:: 5. Eye Blink Detection

    The **Eye Blink Detection** program detects individual eye blinks in real-time and activates an output, like a buzzer or LED. Great for making 
    blink-based interfaces!
    
    Continuously samples the filtered EOG waveform and applies a dynamic threshold + hysteresis to catch 
    the rapid voltage swings caused by an eyelid closing. Whenever the signal crosses the blink threshold, 
    the firmware immediately flags a ‚Äúblink event‚Äù and drives a configurable digital output (LED, buzzer, relay 
    or serial message). 
    
    Because it operates in real‚Äëtime on the microcontroller, you get sub‚Äë50‚ÄØms latency from 
    physical blink to output trigger‚Äîperfect for responsive, blink‚Äëbased user interfaces or assistive‚Äëtech 
    prototypes.

.. dropdown:: 6. EOG DinoGame
 
    The **EOG DinoGame** program controls Chrome Dino Game with your eye blinks! 

    Transforms your blinks into game inputs for Chrome‚Äôs offline ‚ÄúDino Run.‚Äù 
    The Arduino runs the same blink‚Äëdetection algorithm as above, but instead of an onboard 
    LED it sends a simple code over USB serial for each blink. 
    
    A companion script on your PC listens on the COM port and synthesizes a space‚Äëbar keypress 
    whenever a blink event arrives‚Äîletting you jump over cacti and dodge pterodactyls using only your eyes. 
    It‚Äôs a fun demo of how EOG can drive full applications with no hands at all.

    Uses serial communication or USB HID to simulate a jump action when you blink.

.. dropdown:: 7. EOG Servo Control


    The **EOG Servo Control** sketch maps eye blinks to physical motion‚Äîe.g., controlling a servo claw with eye input.
    
    Maps individual blinks (or blink patterns) to precise servo motions for mechanical actuation. 
    Blink events are detected exactly as in the Eye Blink Detection sketch, but here each blink pulses a 
    hobby‚Äëservo control signal (via Arduino‚Äôs Servo library) to move to a predefined angle. 

    You can configure single‚Äëblink/double‚Äëblink sequences to open and close a gripper, nod a toy head, 
    or point an indicator‚Äîshowcasing simple, hands‚Äëfree robotics driven entirely by your eye movements.

.. dropdown:: 8. Vertical Eye Movement Detector
 
    The **Vertical Eye Movement Detector** firmware detects **upward and downward eye movements** using EOG signals captured by the **Eye-BioAmp sensor**.
    It is useful for applications where vertical eye gestures are mapped to specific control functions, such as assistive device interaction or simple user interfaces.
