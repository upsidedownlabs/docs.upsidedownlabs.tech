What is Electroencephalography (EEG)?
**************************************

Electroencephalography (EEG) `[1] <https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875>`_ 
is a method to record an electrogram of the spontaneous electrical activity
of the brain. The bio potential signals detected by EEG have been shown to represent the postsynaptic potentials of 
pyramidal neurons in the neocortex and allocortex. It is typically non-invasive, with the EEG electrodes
placed along the scalp (commonly called "scalp EEG") using the International 10‚Äì20 system,
or variations of it. Clinical interpretation of EEG recordings is most often performed by visual inspection of 
the tracing or quantitative EEG analysis

To know more about EEG `visit here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography>`_.

The International 10‚Äì20 system is a standard method for placing EEG electrodes on the scalp in relation
to the brain's cerebral cortex. Electrode positions are labeled with letters (like Fp, F, T, C, P, O, and Z for
midline) and numbers (odd for left, even for right hemisphere). The "10" and "20" refer to the percentage distances
between electrodes based on the size of the head. Key reference points like the nasion, inion, and preauricular 
points are used for accurate placement. The system helps ensure consistent, repeatable, and comparable EEG
recordings. More detailed versions like the 10‚Äì10 or 10‚Äì5 systems provide higher resolution by adding extra 
electrodes.

.. _experiments step by step:

Let's explore all the experiments step by step
***********************************************
.. Experiment 1

.. dropdown:: 1. Fixed Sampling
    :open:
    
    **1. Program Purpose & Overview**

    The **Fixed Sampling** sketch acquires raw EEG/biopotential data from the Brain‚ÄëBioAmp‚Äôs ADC at 
    a user‚Äëdefined, constant rate. By using a hardware timer interrupt rather than a delay loop, 
    it guarantees uniformly‚Äëspaced samples‚Äîcritical for accurate digital filtering, spectral analysis, 
    or machine‚Äëlearning pipelines downstream.

    **2. How It Works**

    1. Initialize the Sensor Pin    
         
       - The sketch sets an Arduino analog input pin (e.g., A0) to read voltage values from the BioAmp sensor.

    2. Set Sampling Rate

       - A timer (using ``micros()`` or ``delayMicroseconds()``) ensures that we call ``analogRead(A0)`` at a precise interval.

    3. Print Raw Values

       - The user sees raw voltage fluctuations corresponding to brain waves.

    4. Loop Forever

       - The ``loop()`` continues indefinitely, constantly reading and printing.
  
    **3. Perform the Hardware**
    
    - Refer to wiring as per instructions given in :ref:`Connect Your Hardware<Connect Your Hardware>`

    **4. Firmware Upload**

    - For this project, navigate to the repository folder (Brain-BioAmp-Arduino-Firmware/01-fixed-sampling) and select ``01-fixed-sampling.ino``.
    - To upload firmware, refer to :ref:`How to upload the Code to Arduino<How to upload the Code to Arduino>`
    
    **5. Visualize your signal**

    - Follow the steps given in :ref:`Visualize Your Brain Signals!<Visualize Your Brain Signals!>` 
  
    **6. Running & Observing Results**

    - Quiet Baseline (No Signal): Trace hovers near mid‚Äërail.
    - EEG Burst (e.g. Alpha Waves): You observe rhythmic oscillations.
    - Muscle Artifact or Motion: Large, slow deflections riding on the baseline.


    .. Experiment 2

.. dropdown:: 2. EEG Filter
 
    **1. Program Purpose & Overview**

    The EEG Filter sketch acquires raw EEG data from the BioAmp EXG Pill sensor at 256‚ÄØHz and applies 
    a 0.5‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØ29.5‚ÄØHz 4th‚Äëorder Butterworth band‚Äëpass filter (implemented as four biquad sections) to
    isolate true EEG rhythms. By stripping out slow DC drifts and high‚Äëfrequency noise, you obtain a 
    clean EEG stream ideal for real‚Äëtime visualization, event detection, or further spectral analysis.

    **2. How It Works**

    1. Initialize the Sensor Pin    
            
       - The sketch configures an Arduino analog input pin (e.g., A0) to read voltage values from the BioAmp sensor.

    2. Compute Elapsed time
   
       - A static ``past`` timestamp holds the previous sample‚Äôs microsecond count.
       - ``present = micros()`` and ``interval = present ‚Äì past`` give the time since the last loop.
       - ``past`` is updated to present for the next iteration.

    3. Run the Sample Timer
        
       - A static ``timer`` variable counts down by ``interval`` each loop.
       - When ``timer < 0``, it‚Äôs time to take the next sample:

    ::
        
        timer += 1000000 / SAMPLE_RATE;  // ‚âà3906‚ÄØ¬µs for 256‚ÄØHz

    4. Acquire Raw Sample

       - Calls ``analogRead(INPUT_PIN)`` (e.g. ``A0``) to get the latest ADC count from the BioAmp output.
       - Converts the integer reading to a ``float sensor_value``.
    
    5. Apply 4th‚ÄëOrder Butterworth Band‚ÄëPass.
   
       - Passes ``sensor_value`` into ``EEGFilter(input)``, which implements four cascaded biquad sections.
       - Coefficients (``a1, a2, b0, b1, b2``) were generated via SciPy‚Äôs ``butter()`` and exported by ``filter_gen.py``.
       - Each section maintains two static states (``z1``, ``z2``), computes the difference‚Äëequation:

    ::

        x = output ‚Äì a1*z1 ‚Äì a2*z2;
        output = b0*x + b1*z1 + b2*z2;
        z2 = z1;
        z1 = x;

    6. Stream Filtered Output
   
       - After filtering, Serial.println(signal); sends the clean EEG value to your PC or host.

    7. Loop Forever

       - The sketch never blocks: timing logic and filtering run every ‚âà3.9‚ÄØms (256‚ÄØHz), then immediately repeat.

    - To learn more about filters and how to generate new filters, visit:  https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.butter.html

    **3. Perform the Hardware**

    - Refer to wiring as per instructions given in :ref:`Connect Your Hardware<Connect Your Hardware>`

    **4. Firmware Upload**

    - For this project, go to the repository folder (Brain-BioAmp-Arduino-Firmware/02-eeg-filter) and select ``02-eeg-filter.ino``.
    - To upload firmware, refer to :ref:`How to upload the Code to Arduino<How to upload the Code to Arduino>`
    
    **5. Visualize your signal**

    - Follow the steps given in :ref:`Visualize Your Brain Signals!<Visualize Your Brain Signals!>` 
    - You‚Äôll see a smooth EEG waveform updating at 256‚ÄØHz, free of drift and high‚Äëfrequency spikes.

    **6. Running & Observing Results**

    - Quiet Rest (Eyes Closed): Trace should be mostly low‚Äëamplitude noise around zero.
    - Alpha Rhythm (8‚Äì12‚ÄØHz): Rhythmic oscillations become clearly visible after you close your eyes and relax.
    - Movement Artifacts (>30‚ÄØHz): Spikes from blinks or muscle tension are greatly attenuated, keeping the focus on EEG bands.
.. Experiment 3

.. dropdown:: 3. BCI FFT

    This foundational sketch is designed to display real-time EEG bandpower values‚ÄîDelta, Theta, Alpha, Beta,
    and Gamma‚Äîon the Arduino IDE‚Äôs Serial Monitor. It serves as a powerful tool for observing how your brain 
    state affects brainwave activity. For instance, you‚Äôll notice a rise in beta waves when focusing on a single 
    point, and an increase in alpha waves when you close your eyes and relax. It‚Äôs ideal for understanding how 
    different activities in the brain influence your EEG signals.

    For this project, you need to do **electrode placement** as per the given figure:

.. Experiment 4

.. dropdown:: 4. BCI LED

    This sketch allows you to control the built-in LED on the Arduino UNO R4 using your focus. 
    When your beta activity rises (indicating strong concentration), the LED lights up. As your mind relaxes 
    and beta power drops, the LED turns off. It creates a simple yet effective neurofeedback to train and 
    observe your concentration levels.

.. dropdown:: 5. BCI Toggle

    The BCI Toggle program enables hands-free toggling of the built-in LED using sustained focus. 
    By maintaining your concentration for 4‚Äì5 seconds, the system switches the LED on or off, 
    like flipping a switch using your brain. This method can be extended to control other devices, 
    making it a stepping stone for brain-controlled automation.

.. dropdown:: 6. BCI Spiral

    The BCI Spiral program is one of the most engaging and interesting sketch as it transforms your focus into gameplay. 
    
    Running on the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi, it controls the 12√ó8 LED matrix on the board. 
    As you concentrate, LEDs begin to light up in a clockwise spiral pattern. 
    
    The more intense and sustained your focus, the more the spiral progresses. 
    If your concentration lapses, the spiral unwinds in reverse. This sketch creates an immersive and intuitive 
    brain-training game driven entirely by your EEG signals.
