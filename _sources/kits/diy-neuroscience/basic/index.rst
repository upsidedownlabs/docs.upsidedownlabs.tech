Using the kit
**************

This kit is made in a way so that even beginners can use it and get started with recording biopotential signals from their body to explore the field of neuroscience by making HCI/BCI projects.

Step 1 (optional): Configure for EMG/ECG
=========================================

.. figure:: media/configuration-emg-ecg.*
    :align: center

BioAmp EXG Pill is by default configured for recording EEG or EOG, so if you are recording any of the two signals 
you can skip this step. But if you want to record good quality ECG or EMG, then it is recommended to configure it 
by making a solder joint as shown in the image above.

.. note:: Even without making the solder joint the BioAmp EXG Pill is capable of recording ECG or EMG as well but the signals would be more accurate if you configure it.

Step 2: Connect Maker UNO
==========================

.. figure:: media/connection-with-maker-uno.*
    :align: center

Connect ``VCC`` to ``5V``, ``GND`` to ``GND``, and ``OUT`` to ``Analog pin A0`` of your Maker UNO via jumper cables provided by us. If you are connecting OUT to any other analog pin, then you will have to change the INPUT PIN in the arduino sketch accordingly.

.. warning:: Take precautions while connecting to power, if power pins (GND & VCC) are to be swapped, your BioAmp EXG Pill will be fried and itâ€™ll become unusable (DIE).

Step 3: Connecting electrode cable
===============================================

.. figure:: media/bioamp-cable.*
    :align: center

Connect the BioAmp cable to BioAmp EXG Pill by inserting the cable end in the JST PH connector as shown above.

Step 4: Skin Preparation
===============================================

Apply Nuprep Skin Preparation Gel on the skin surface where electrodes would be placed to remove dead skin cells and clean the skin from dirt. After rubbing the skin surface thoroughly, clean it with an alcohol wipe or a wet wipe.

For more information, please check out detailed step by step :ref:`skin-preparation`.

Step 5: Measuring EMG (ElectroMyoGraphy)
===========================================

Electrodes placement
----------------------

We have 2 options to measure the EMG signals, either using the gel electrodes or using dry electrode based Muscle BioAmp Band. You can try both of them one by one.

- **Using gel electrodes:**

1. Connect the BioAmp cable to gel electrodes,
2. Peel the plastic backing from electrodes
3. Place the IN+ and IN- cables on the arm near the ulnar nerve & REF (reference) at the back of your hand as shown in the connection diagram.

.. figure:: media/emg.*
    :align: center

- **Using Muscle BioAmp Band:**

1. Connect the BioAmp cable to Muscle BioAmp Band in a way such that IN+ and IN- are placed on the arm near the ulnar nerve & REF (reference) on the far side of the band.
2. Now put a small drop of electrode gel between the skin and metallic part of BioAmp cable to get the best results.

.. tip:: Visit the complete documentation on how to :ref:`assemble and use the BioAmp Bands <using-bioamp-bands>` or follow the youtube video given below.

   **Tutorial on how to use the band:**

Step 8: Measuring EEG (ElectroEncephaloGraphy)
===============================================

Let's understand the electrode placements before moving forward in this project. For recording EEG from 
different parts of the brain, you have to place the electrodes according to the `International 10-20 system for recording EEG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_(EEG)>`_.

.. figure:: media/10-20-system.*
    :align: center
    :width: 80%

Electrodes placement
----------------------

We have 2 options to measure the EEG signals, either using the gel electrodes or using dry electrode based Brain BioAmp Band. You can try both of them one by one.

- **Using gel electrodes to record from prefrontal cortex part of brain:**

.. figure:: media/eeg.*
    :align: center

1. Connect the BioAmp cable to gel electrodes.
2. Peel the plastic backing from electrodes.
3. Place the IN+ and IN- cables on Fp1 and Fp2 as per the International 10-20 system & REF (reference) at the bony part, on the back side of your earlobe as shown above.

- **Using Brain BioAmp Band to record from prefrontal cortex part of brain:**

1. Connect the BioAmp cable to Brain BioAmp Band in a way such that IN+ and IN- are placed on Fp1 and Fp2 as per the International 10-20 system.
2. In this case, the REF (reference) should be connected using gel electrode. So connect the reference of BioAmp cable to the gel electrode, peel the plastic backing and place it at the bony part, on the back side of your earlobe.
3. Now put a small drop of electrode gel on the dry electrodes (IN+ and IN-) between the skin and metallic part of BioAmp cable to get the best results.

.. note:: Similarly you can use the band to record EEG signals from the visual cortex part of brain by placing the dry electrodes on O1 and O2 instead of Fp1 and Fp2. Everything else will remain the same.

.. tip:: Visit the complete documentation on how to :ref:`assemble and use the BioAmp Bands <using-bioamp-bands>` or follow the youtube video given below.

   **Tutorial on how to use the band:**

   .. youtube:: O6qp7teT-sM
       :align: center
       :width: 100%

Uploading the code
-----------------------

Connect the Maker Uno to your laptop using the USB cable (Type A to Type B). Copy paste the Arduino Sketch given below in Arduino IDE v1.8.19 that you downloaded earlier:
    
`Spike recorder arduino code <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BackyardBrains/SpikerShield/master/Muscle/Arduino%20Code/SpikeRecorder/SpikeRecorderSpikerShield_V1_1.ino>`_

Go to ``tools`` from the menu bar, select ``board`` option then select Arduino UNO. In the same menu, 
select the COM port on which your Maker Uno is connected. To find out the right COM port, 
disconnect your Maker UNO board and reopen the menu. The entry that disappears should be the 
right COM port. Now upload the code.

.. warning:: Make sure your laptop is not connected to a charger and sit 5m away from any AC appliances for best signal acquisition.

Visualizing the EEG signals
-------------------------------

Open up your BackyardBrains Spike Recorder software. At first, it will monitor signals from your microphone. To change that, go to the settings by clicking 
the :fas:`gear` icon on the top left corner of the screen, select the COM port on which the Maker UNO is connected and click on connect. 

.. figure:: media/spike-recorder-configurations.*
    :align: center

Mute the speakers and apply the 50Hz notch filter by clicking on the checkbox as shown in the screenshot above. You should 
set the low band pass filter to 1Hz and high bandpass filter to 40Hz as we are only recording the EEG signals which range between 
these frequencies.

Now everything is configured and connected. So close the settings window and start recording EEG signals.

    :alt: Recording EEG from pre-frontal cortex part of brain

    Recording EEG signals from pre-frontal cortex

The signals that you can see on the screen right now are originating from prefrontal cortex part of your brain and propagating through all the layers to the surface of your skin.

To record these EEG signals, you have placed the electrodes on the forehead (Fp1 & Fp2), then BioAmp EXG Pill is amplifying those signals so that we can detect it and finally sending it to the ADC (Analog to Digital Convertor) of your Maker Uno. Ultimately the signals are being visualized in Spike Recorder software.

We hope everything is clear now and you understand how the signals are propagating from your brain to the screen of the laptop.

**Features of Spike Recorder that you can explore:**

- Increase or decrease the scale of the Y axis by clicking on the + and - icons respecitively that is present on the left side of the graph.
- Increase or decrease the X axis timescale by sliding up and down on the scroll wheel of the mouse.
- Visualize the FFT graph by clicking on the FFT icon on top left size of the screen.
- Record the data in .wav format by clicking the record icon on the top right corner. You can convert this data in any other format according to your project requirements.
- Listen to the signals by clicking the volume icon on the top right corner. No don't smile right now, that's how your brain sounds like :P
