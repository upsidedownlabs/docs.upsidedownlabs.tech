Introduction
***************

This course is designed to provide a thorough understanding of extracellular electrophysiology, a branch 
for studying the electrical activity of neurons and other excitable cells. It includes recorded lectures with hands-on 
electronics exercises to ensure that you gain both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

.. note:: We want to thank Open Ephys team for creating this course. Their hard work and expertise in developing and sharing this 
 material are greatly appreciated. You can find the original course at `OE Ephys Course <https://ahleighton.github.io/OE-ephys-course/index.html#>`_.

Materials for students
************************

The course consists of 2 segments - Theory and experiments. Read the theory segments carefully before performing the experiments to get a better understanding of all the concepts.

To read before Day 1:
